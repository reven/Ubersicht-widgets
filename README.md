# Ubersicht-widgets

This is a compilation of the [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) widgets I've created. I've used Geektool for years, and ther are features that I really miss from it (like editing properties of the widget and seeing the effect in real time), but I've had a blast porting my old widgets to Übersicht, playing with html and CSS to get them to look just how I wanted and polishing the code or the command calls while I was at it.

I wanted to have them all together in one place, even though the ones I dedicate more work to will have their own repo.
