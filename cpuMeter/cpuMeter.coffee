# CPU meter, minimal CPU usage meter widget for Ãœbersicht, styled as an old school V.U. meter
# Takes into account cores and tries to make a very low resource intensive call to ps instead
# of top as I've seen in other similar widgets.
# To do: the number of cores and the colors used could be a variable.
